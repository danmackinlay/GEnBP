# Gaussian Ensemble Belief Propagation

A method for handling high-dimensional inference with simualtors.
Think: working out how to calibrate your climate model using staellite images.
For a casual introduction, see [this blog post](https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/genbp/).

Experiments from the paper are generated by the notebooks whose names start with `mp_`.

Development was supported by the [CSIRO MLAI Future Science Platform](https://github.com/csiro-mlai/).

This is academic prototype code. It is not production-ready.
Pull requests welcome.

## Installation

Install the requirements.

```bash
python3 -m venv --prompt probop ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate  # linux or macos, bash-like
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=probop  # for jupyter
```
