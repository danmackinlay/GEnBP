# Gaussian Ensemble Belief Propagation

experiments from the paper are generated by the notebooks whose names start with `mp_`.

Development was supported by the [CSIRO MLAI Future Science Platform](https://github.com/csiro-mlai/).

This is academic prototype code. It is not production-ready.
Pull requests welcome.
